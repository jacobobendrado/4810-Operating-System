# Tools Used for Development

### QEMU
- A generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
- To get a jumpstart on using QEMU, check out the tldr documentation [here](https://tldr.inbrowser.app/pages/common/qemu)
    - The official documentation can be found at [Qemu Documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/)
- Debug is easy since you can connect GDB to a virtual machine to debug code that runs on it, through QEMU's built-in GDB server.
    - See more about using GDB in QEMU [here](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/gdb.html).
    - Also, check out Operating Systems: From 0 to 1. In the Chapter on bootloaders (page 197), it walks through and example.
