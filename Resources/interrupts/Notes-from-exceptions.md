# Exceptions
Exceptions are interrupts generated by the CPU when an "error" occurs.
These "errors" are not always really something going wrong; things like page faults are one example.
Some, but not all, exceptions push an error code to the stack to provide additional information about the error.

### Types of Exceptions
- Faults: Can be corrected, and the program can continue like nothing happened (ex. page faults)
- Traps: Specific instructions that are reported right after the trapping instruction (ex. breakpoints)
- Aborts: Severe unrecoverable error (ex. double faults)
