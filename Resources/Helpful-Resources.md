## Tools
#### QEMU
- A generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
- To get a jumpstart on using QEMU, check out the tldr documentation [here](https://tldr.inbrowser.app/pages/common/qemu)
    - The official documentation can be found at [Qemu Documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/)
- Debug is easy since you can connect GDB to a virtual machine to debug code that runs on it, through QEMU's built-in GDB server.
    - See more about using GDB in QEMU [here](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/gdb.html).
    - Also, check out Operating Systems: From 0 to 1. In the Chapter on bootloaders (page 197), it walks through and example.

#### as
- Portable GNU assembler. Primarily intended to assemble output from `gcc` to be used by `ld`.
- To get a jumpstart on using `as`, check out the tldr documentation [here](https://tldr.inbrowser.app/pages/linux/as)

#### make
- Task runner for targets described in Makefile. Mostly used to control the compilation of an executable from source code.
- To get a jumpstart on using `make`, check out the tldr documentation [here](https://tldr.inbrowser.app/pages/common/make)

#### gdb
- The GNU debugger. We can use it with QEMU to debug a kernel.
- To use `gdb` with QEMU, check out the documentation [here](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/gdb.html)
